<p style="font-family:courier;"><center>My name is Anna, and I am currently a Senior at Michigan State University. I started this small business the summer after my first year of college, and it has been an incredible journey. I began by posting a few items every week to posting anywhere from 50-100 items a week!</center></p>

<br> 
 
<p style="font-family:courier;"><center>I have a massive passion for fashion and a huge passion for sustainability. This venture of mine was an incredible way that I was able to merge both of my passions together! I am so beyond thankful for your support!</center></p>
